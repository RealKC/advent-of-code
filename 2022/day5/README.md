# AoC Day 5

This day requires you first run the Rust executable to preprocess the input into something usable.

So, in the `rust/` subdirectory you have to run `cargo r`, which will produce `crates.in` and `instructions.in`,
these are usable as input to `Ex.solve_part_one` and `Ex.solve_part_two` in the Elixir project.
